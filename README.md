# About the project

A project made in accordance with the philosophers project which is part of the Codam Core Curriculum. One or more philosophers sit at a round table. There is a large bowl of spaghetti in the middle of the table. Philosophers need two forks to eat the spaghetti. There are as man forks as philosophers. The challenge is to write a program that lets the philosophers dine without starving. Each philosopher is a thread and the availability of each forks is protected by a mutex.

# Getting started

Start by cloning the repository:
```c
https://github.com/fkoolhoven/philosophers.git
```
Go into the philo directory and compile by using make:
```c
make
```

# Usage

```c
./philosophers [number_of_philosophers] [time_to_die time_to_eat] [time_to_sleep] [number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat]
```
- number_of_philosophers: The number of philosophers and also the number of forks.
- time_to_die (in milliseconds): If a philosopher didnâ€™t start eating time_to_die milliseconds since the beginning of their last meal or the beginning of the simulation, they die.
- time_to_eat (in milliseconds): The time it takes for a philosopher to eat. During that time, they will need to hold two forks.
- time_to_sleep (in milliseconds): The time a philosopher will spend sleeping.
- number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat (optional argument): If all philosophers have eaten at least number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat times, the simulation stops. If not specified, the simulation stops when a philosopher dies.

For example:
```c
./philo 6 800 200 200 3 
```
will let 6 philosophers eat 3 times.
```c

Or:
```c
./philo 4 310 200 200
```
will let the simulation run until 1 philosopher starves.

# Important learnings

1. Learned to create and join threads.
2. Learned about what causes race conditions.
3. Learned how to prevent race conditions using mutexes.
4. Additionally I worked on making the output as easy to read as possible, adding colors and appropriate (error) messages.
